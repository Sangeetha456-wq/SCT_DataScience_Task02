🧠 Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 2

Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
In this task, I have performed Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the popular Titanic Dataset, focusing on uncovering patterns and survival trends.



📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle, containing details of passengers such as age, gender, class, and survival status.




🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

Google Colab

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn




📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🔹 Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values in Age, Embarked, and Cabin

Removed irrelevant columns

Converted categorical variables


🔹 Visualization:

Survival distribution by Gender, Class, and Age

Bar charts and histograms to highlight passenger trends




✅ Conclusion

This analysis helped identify significant survival trends based on various passenger attributes. It provides a clear base for further machine learning modeling and prediction.




Thank you for reviewing my submission! 🙏
